## 🧩 Latest work and repositories

Here are some of the repositories that reflect my current interests and daily work.

> Tip: I use a mix of production-like playgrounds and small focused repos to test ideas about performance, architecture, and DX.

- 🔁 <strong>Render and performance labs</strong>  
  Experiments around React performance pitfalls, memoization, virtualization, and profiling.

- 🧱 <strong>Component library experiments</strong>  
  Reusable UI patterns that mirror real production systems, inspired by shadcn/ui principles.

- 🧪 <strong>Architecture and patterns</strong>  
  Small repos that explore clean architecture, feature-sliced design, state machines, and microfrontends.
